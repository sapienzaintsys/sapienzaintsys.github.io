	title					=	{On the Complexity of Rational Verification.},
	abstract			=	{Rational verification refers to the problem of checking which temporal logic properties hold of a concurrent/multiagent system, under the assumption that agents in the system choose strategies that form a game theoretic equilibrium. Rational verification can be understood as a counterpart to model checking for multiagent systems, but while classical model checking can be done in polynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such as CTL, and polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational verification is much harder: the key decision problems for rational verification are 2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications, even when using explicit-state system representations. Against this background, our contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we show that the complexity of rational verification can be greatly reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a fragment of LTL that can represent a broad and practically useful class of response properties of reactive systems. In particular, we show that for a number of relevant settings, rational verification can be done in polynomial space and even in polynomial time. Second, we provide improved complexity results for rational verification when considering players’ goals given by mean-payoff utility functions—arguably the most widely used approach for quantitative objectives in concurrent and multiagent systems. Finally, we consider the problem of computing outcomes that satisfy social welfare constraints. To this end, we consider both utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare and show that computing such outcomes is either PSPACE-complete or NP-complete.

	title					=	{Equilibria for Games with Combined Qualitative and Quantitative Objectives.},
	abstract			=	{	The overall aim of our research is to develop techniques to reason about the equilibrium properties of multi-agent systems.
	We model multi-agent systems as concurrent games, in which each player is a process that is assumed to act independently and strategically in pursuit of personal preferences.
	In this article, we study these games in the context of finite-memory strategies, and we assume players' preferences are defined by a qualitative 
	and a quantitative objective, which are related by a lexicographic order: a player first prefers to satisfy its qualitative objective (given as a
	formula of Linear Temporal Logic) and then prefers to minimise costs (given by a mean-payoff function).
	Our main result is that deciding the existence of a strict $\epsilon$ Nash equilibrium in such games is 2\textsc{ExpTime}-complete (and hence decidable), even if players' deviations are implemented as infinite-memory strategies.},

	title     		= {Expressiveness and Nash Equilibrium in Iterated Boolean Games},
	abstract			= "{We define and investigate a novel notion of expressiveness for temporal logics that is based on game theoretic equilibria of multi-agent systems. We use \emph{iterated Boolean games} as our abstract model of multi-agent systems. In such a game, each agent~$i$ has a goal~$\gamma_i$, represented using (a fragment of) Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The goal~$\gamma_i$ captures agent~$i$'s preferences, in the sense that the models of~$\gamma_i$ represent system behaviours that would satisfy~$i$. Each player controls a subset of Boolean variables $\Phi_i$, and at each round in the game, player $i$ is at liberty to choose values for variables $\Phi_i$ in any way that she sees fit. Play continues for an infinite sequence of rounds, and so as players act they collectively trace out a model for LTL, which for every player will either satisfy or fail to satisfy their goal. Players are assumed to act strategically, taking into account the goals of other players, in an attempt to bring about computations satisfying their goal. In this setting, we apply the standard game-theoretic concept of (pure) Nash equilibria. The (possibly empty) set of Nash equilibria of an iterated Boolean game can be understood as inducing a set of computations, each computation representing one way the system could evolve if players chose strategies that together constitute a Nash equilibrium. Such a set of equilibrium computations expresses a temporal property---which may or may not be expressible within a particular LTL fragment. The new notion of expressiveness that we formally define and investigate is then as follows: \emph{what temporal properties are characterised by the Nash equilibria of games in which agent goals are expressed in fragments of~LTL}? We formally define and investigate this notion of expressiveness and related issues, for a range of LTL fragments. For example, a very natural question is the following. Suppose we have an iterated Boolean game in which every goal is represented using a particular fragment of LTL: then is it always the case that the equilibria of the game can be characterised within such fragment? We show that this is not true in general.}",

	title					=	{Multi-Player Games with LDL Goals over Finite Traces.},
	abstract			=	{Linear Dynamic Logic on finite traces (LDLF) is a powerful logic for reasoning about the behaviour of concurrent and multi-agent systems.
	In this paper, we investigate techniques for both the characterisation and verification of equilibria in multi-player games with goals/objectives expressed using logics based on LDLF.
	This study builds upon a generalisation of Boolean games, a logic-based game model of multi-agent systems where players have goals succinctly represented in a logical way.
	Because LDLF goals are considered, in the settings we study - Reactive Modules games and iterated Boolean games with goals over finite traces - players' goals can be defined to be regular properties while achieved in a finite, but arbitrarily large, trace. 
	In particular, using alternating automata, the paper investigates automata-theoretic approaches to the characterisation and verification of (pure strategy Nash) equilibria, shows that the set of Nash equilibria in multi-player games with LDLF objectives is regular, and provides complexity results for the associated automata constructions.},
