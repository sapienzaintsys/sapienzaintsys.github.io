ISLab (Intelligent Systems Lab) is a research group of the Department of Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome.

Our research regards many aspects of Intelligent Systems in Artificial Intelligence, examined with the rigorous lenses of Formal Methods. We are particularly fond of **Process Mining**, **Declarative Modelling**, **Verification and Synthesis**, **Knowledge Representation**, and **Automated and Strategic Reasoning**.
